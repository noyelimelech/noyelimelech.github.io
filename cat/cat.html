                    <h2>cat</h2>
                    <br>The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                    <br> It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
                    <br> and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish
                    <br> it from the wild members of the family.
                    <br>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat
                    <br>the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.

                    <h2>size</h2>
                    <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull
                       <br>and shorter bones than the European wildcat.
                       <br>It averages about 46 cm in head-to-body length and 23â€“25 cm in height,
                       <br>with about 30 cm long tails. Males are larger than females.
                       <br>Adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg .

                    <h2> Skeleton</h2>
                    <p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals).
                        <br>13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12).
                        <br>seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five).
                        <br>three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five).
                        <br>and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).
                        <br>11 The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility.
                        <br>Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.
                        <br>Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder
                        <br>by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.
